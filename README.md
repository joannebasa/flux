# Flux

This is a simple responsive application that can list player's names and randomise them.

## How to download

* see documentation https://github.com/joannebasa/flux.git

```
git clone https://github.com/joannebasa/flux.git
```

* Go to folder, right-click on the index.html file, open in your browser of choice

## Getting Started

The interface consists of an input field where you can type your player's names. 
Please ensure that you only enter one name at a time.

There are three buttons that tell what you can do to the names you just typed. 

The blue one adds them to the list that appears below the buttons, and pressing [ENTER] on your keyboard will work just fine.
Once you have typed all the player's names, the green button pairs them up randomly, and displays them accordingly in a green list. 
Should there be an error in typing their names, pressing the red button removes the last name in the  blue list.

Flux also comes with an error message in red. This happens on two instances: 

* The blue list has an odd number of players when you pressed it. You can either press the red button once to delete the last name on the blue
list, or type another name on the input field. Once there is an even number of players, the error message should disappear. The error message 
also tells you how many players you currently have.
* The error message also appears when there are no players on the list.

There is no need to reload this page when you see the red error message.
